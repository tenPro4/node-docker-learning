docker swarm
create multi instance will enable less down time during new update is up.
let say we have 3 instance for app
when up is process, the first instance will down for update but the rest instance will keep live which user wont get the down time effect


Init swarm(swarm is disable as default)

-docker swarm init
-docker swarm init --advertise-addr ip_address


command to use docker swarm
-docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml -c docker-compose.prod.yml any_name(stackName)
-docker node ls
-docker stack ls
-docker stack services stack_name

just repeat again if got any update on image
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml -c docker-compose.prod.yml
